We make horror music in a world full of horrors.

Insidious and mondane horror, that often go unnoticed if you don't look closely enough or if you're not experiencing it first hand.
The horror of being comfortable in a system built upon violence, oppression and control.

That's why we are committed to fight fascism and white supremacy in all of it's forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and it's abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question it's binary. To actively unlearn bias and colonial thinking, to look inside and face these parts of our collective darkness and come out of it with more kindness and compassion.

We strive to use our platform to give a voice to marginalized folks, people of color, trans, non-binary, queer people, disabled folks and people living at the intersection of these identities and to give back to our local communities.

And we remember that this city, Tiohti√†:ke is the traditional and unceded territory of the kanien'keha:ka (Mohawk), a place which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst nations.
