Blood and Dust is a collaboration of two dark queerdos inspired by horror cinema
and occult myth. Part horror drone, part spookfolk, part post-rock, they blend
synth and cello into nightmarish auditory rituals.


It is the music you hear while wandering a cursed manor at night, calling you to the basement where
dreadful things happen. Bring your salt, and stay safe while communing with the
dead.


Visuals are definitely tightly intertwined with the song creation, and
they also often inspire us musicallyâ€”i.e., the two mediums feed into each other,
which I guess is unsurprising, coming from two cinephiles who found a lot of
inspiration in old horror movies (and their iconic scores) when we were
initiating the project. We often use a color-grading technique reminiscent of
the old Technicolor process and 16mm-film grain to give our photos and videos
the quality of an old occult tape someone found in a dusty attic.
